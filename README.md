# WEDE5020-POE-part-1
Greetings, the purpose of this assignment was to give the basic skeleton structure of my website for the meals and weals organisation. 
The website begins of ways for people to sign and login so that it is easier for the organisation to identify individuals and to make 
them feel acknowledged. 
The website continues to show information such as goals, objectives and a guideline donators can use to donate meals to the needy. 
This website consists of codes ive learnt during my secondary years that create basic creation of an html website including tables etc.
